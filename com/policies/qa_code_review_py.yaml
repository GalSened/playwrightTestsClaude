description: Default policy for Python code review with QA context

# Weight configuration for hybrid retrieval
weights:
  pinned: 3.0        # Prioritize explicitly pinned events
  importance: 2.0    # Moderate importance weight
  semantic: 1.6      # Moderate semantic matching
  recency: 1.0       # Standard recency bias
  diversity: 0.5     # Low diversity (focus on relevant context)

# Token budget for context packing
budget_tokens: 4096  # Standard budget (fits in most LLM contexts)

# Event type filtering
event_types:
  - test_failure
  - code_change
  - agent_action

# Minimum importance threshold (0-5 scale)
min_importance: 2.0

# Tag filtering
tags_include:
  - regression
  - flaky

# Include roll-up summaries for broader context
include_rollups: true

# Maximum events to retrieve
max_events: 50

# Retrieval strategy notes
# This is the default policy for general code review tasks
# Balances comprehensiveness with token efficiency
