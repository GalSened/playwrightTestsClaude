WeSign QA Intelligence Knowledge Base Test Document

This is a test document for the QA Intelligence knowledge base system. It demonstrates how Elysia can process and store documents with embedding generation for semantic search capabilities.

Key features being tested:
1. Document upload and processing
2. Text chunking for optimal embedding generation
3. OpenAI embedding integration
4. SQLite storage with BLOB embedding storage
5. High-performance search capabilities

The Elysia framework provides 21x better performance compared to Express.js, making it ideal for processing large volumes of test documentation, API specifications, and knowledge base content.

This document will be processed into chunks, embedded using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model, and stored in the enhanced knowledge base for future semantic search operations.
